        <div class="subtopic-label">
          NOTE: If you are using VS Code and the extension solution explorer you will have the possibility to add projects to solution by right clicking on the solution name.
        </div>
        <div>First you set up a folder with the name of the future project. e.g.: WebAPIv3 cd inside of that project folder and type <code>dotnet new sln</code>, no need to specifiy the name as it will take it from the outer folder name.</div>
        <br>
        <div>Creating the web api where the controllers are contained is done at the same level as the sln in the project folder. Type <code>dotnet new webapi -o name_of_main_project</code> and give it a significative name, usually the same as the folder containing the whole project, aka, WebAPIv3</div>
        <br>
        <div>Now add that newly created project to the solution: <code>dotnet sln add WebAPIv3</code>. Apparently a wwwroot empty folder is added but you can delete that.</div>
        <br>
        <div>To run and test <code>dotnet run --project WebAPIv3</code>, you need to specifiy the main project that runs the entire solution.</div>
        <br>
        <div>Now let's add another project that will contain the models needed for the solution. Start with <code>dotnet new classlib -o WebAPIv3.Models</code> and add it to the solution like earlier, <code>dotnet sln add WebAPIv3.Models</code></div>
        <div>To gain intellisense and to add a reference: <code>dotnet add WebAPIv3 reference WebAPIv3.Models</code>. This tells the main project that it needs to know of another project, in this case, the Models. From here Omnisharp will give us suggestions like Use deleteMe.API.Models when referencing any models contained in the models project.</div>
        <br>
        <div>So, create the project as classlib, add it to the solution and finally add a reference to the main project in the solution.</div>
